What is your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you have worked
on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but we would love to know why you are proud of
it.

In my First company, one of the system database(Master) is corrupted. As I'm very new to Database
Administration and I only had the theory knowledge of how to rebuild the Master, I informed my Lead
that I will work on it and I was very fortunate that my lead gave me chance to work on it. I was
successful in retrieving the data. I was appreciated by all my team members, and I felt very proud of it, as I was a fresher and it was my first appreciation. Even though I got more
appreciations, I still cherish that as one of my best acheivements.

Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should
read it as well.

Recently I started reading a book on Site Reliability Engineering (How Google runs on production
systems) from O'Reilly. As a devops Engineer, i want to enhance my skills towards the best practices in the industry. It really gives a clear picture some of the best parctices for an SRE. Many
might have already read it, if not, then itâ€™s my suggestion.

2.Jenkins

One of the biggest problems of Jenkins is its scalability. To achieve a decent result we run our builds
on dedicated Jenkins slaves. These EC2 instances are running all the time. But this solution is not
cost-effective. What could be a good approach to provision these slaves in AWS?

Cost-effectiveness was also encountered in Lowes. We went through the problem, and had discussions with the SRE team, and finally came up with the solution of using Spot Insatances. 

With Spot Instances, we can spin up instances for a particular time and then terminate them after certain time. So we can delete the worker nodes(most) in the evening as they will not be used much at night so this way we can reduce cost.
